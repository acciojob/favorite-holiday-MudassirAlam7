	<h1>Texas</h1><br>
	<p>As of May 2024, the 1,225 Texas municipalities[3][a] include 971 cities, 231 towns, and 23 villages. These designations are determined by United States Census Bureau requirements based on state statutes and may not match a municipality's self-reported designation.[4] The types of municipalities in Texas are defined in the Local Government Code, which was codified in 1987. The designations of city, town and village were superseded by Type A, B, and C general-law cities in the code</p>
